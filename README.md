## The Model
The vehicle model used here is the suggested Global Kinemtic Model. It has 6 states, position of x,
and y, velocity, orientation, cross track error and orientation error. 2 actuators are used, throttle
ranges from -1 to 1, where negative value means breaking and steering angle from -25 degree to 25 degree.
The update equation is as follows:
```
x_[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
y_[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
psi_[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * (-delta[t]) * dt
v_[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt
epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * (-delta[t]) / Lf * dt
```
The delta here is negative because the delta is positive anti-clockwise while the simulator takes the 
delta negative anti-clockwise.

## Timestep Length and Frequency
The timestep here is 100 milliseconds and N is 10. As of the latency the simulator in the VM, The total time T here 
is set to 1s, and N is set to 10 to lower down the use of CPU. Other values are tested but the final one is 1 second 
with timestep in 100 milliseconds and number N in 10.

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
To make life easier, fisrt I change the waypoint received from simulator from map coordinate to vehicle 
coordinate with coordinate transform equation. Then with the transformed coordinate, the coefficiencies
are calculated with ployfit function. the coefficiencies are used to calculate the cross track error and
orientation error. the cte is equal with 'polyeval(coeffs, 0)' since the y is 0, and epsi is equal with 
the first order derivative of reference trajectory. The coefficiencies are also used for the reference 
trajectory ploting.

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
As I running the simulator within the virtual machine in the VirtualBox. The latency here is quite 
significant, which confused me a lot at the beginning. To reduce the impact of latency I put much more
weight on the cost of delta change and throttle change. The cost weights are as follows:
```
    const int cte_cost_weight = 20;
    const int epsi_cost_weight = 20;
    const int v_cost_weight = 1;
    const int delta_cost_weight = 10;
    const int a_cost_weight = 10;
    const int delta_change_cost_weight = 1000;
    const int a_change_cost_weight = 1000;
```
And to tackle with latency, I start projecting the vehicle position forward and slow down the reference velocity.
The following choices are tested,

| speed | dt | result |
|-|-|-|
| 40 | 0.2 | nok with cost 500 |
| 40 | 0.3 | nok |
| 30 | 0.2 | ok with cost 200 |
| 30 | 0.1 | nok |
| 10 | 0.1 | ok |
| 20 | 0.1 | nok |

And it seems that setting 200ms forward with 30 mph can make through the cirle, though
the cost is nearly 200.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Build with Docker-Compose
The docker-compose can run the project into a container
and exposes the port required by the simulator to run.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Build image: `docker-compose build`
3. Run Container: `docker-compose up`
4. On code changes repeat steps 2 and 3.

## Tips

1. The MPC is recommended to be tested on examples to see if implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, it tracks the reference line after some timesteps(not too many).
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has waypoints of the lake track. This could fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We have kept editor configuration files out of this repo to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. We omitted IDE profiles to ensure
students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. Most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
